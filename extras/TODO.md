## TO-DO for GeoGadget
- [ ] implement sleep_mode (like in OpenLog project)
- [x] change the way of DateTime fix (try to avoid TOW parsing to get date and time, disable parsing GPSTime)
- [ ] make dir YYYYMMDD to separate GPX files
- [ ] do sd.sync every 10 secs (its too expensive operation)
- [ ] upgrade to GPX 1.1
- [ ] add header info to GPX (Geo-Gadged, version, url)
